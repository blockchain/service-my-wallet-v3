## Getting Started

To use this API, you will need to run small local service which be responsible for managing your Blockchain.info wallet. Your application interacts with this service locally via HTTP API calls.

Start by completing the following steps:

  1. Follow the [installation instructions](#installation)
  2. Start the server: `$ blockchain-wallet-service start --port 3000`
  3. Reference the [documentation](#api-documentation) and start interacting with your wallet programmatically!

Note that `blockchain-wallet-service` is designed to be run locally on the same machine as your application and therefore will only accept connections from `localhost`. If you modify this service to accept external connections, be sure to add the appropriate firewall rules to prevent unauthorized use.

An API code is required for wallet creation and higher request limits. For basic usage, no API code is required. Request an API code [here](https://blockchain.info/api/api_create_code).

## Upgrading

If you already have an application that uses [Blockchain.info's Wallet API](https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_wallet_api), you will need to complete the steps in the Getting Started section above and then, in your application code, replace calls to `blockchain.info/merchant/...` with `localhost:<port>/merchant/...`.

## API Documentation

View the [original documentation](https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_wallet_api).

All endpoints present in the API documentation above are supported in Blockchain Wallet API V2. The differences between two are:

  * The "consolidate addresses" endpoint has been omitted

All endpoints can be called with `GET` or `POST`, and can only be accessed from `localhost`.

## RPC

Bitcoind compatible RPC API. Full documentation available [here](https://blockchain.info/api/json_rpc_api).

Starting the RPC server:

```
$ blockchain-wallet-service start-rpc [options]
```

View additional options and instructions under [Usage](#usage).

Differences from server API:

  * Option `-rpcssl` is not supported
  * Method `listsinceblock` is not supported
  * Param `minConfimations` is not supported for methods `listreceivedbyaccount` and `listreceivedbyaddress`
  * Param `minimumConfirmations` is not supported for method `getbalance`
  * Param `confirmations` is not supported for method `listaccounts`
  * Responses representing transactions have a different format

## Installation

[`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org) and [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) are required to install and use this API service. Installation:

```sh
$ npm install -g blockchain-wallet-service
```

For the best stability and performance, make sure you are always using the latest version.

To check your version:

```sh
$ blockchain-wallet-service -V
```

To update to the latest version:

```sh
$ npm update -g blockchain-wallet-service
```

Requires:

  * node >= 0.12.0
  * npm >= 2.12.0, < 3.0.0

If you have issues with the installation process, see the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

Installation errors:

  * If you are getting `EACCESS` or permissions-related errors, it might be necessary to run the install as root, using the `sudo` command.

Startup errors:

  * If startup fails with `/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory`, it's possible node is not installed, or was installed with a different name (Ubuntu, for example, installs node as nodejs). If node was installed with a different name, create a symlink to your node binary: `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`, or install node through [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Runtime errors:

  * If you are seeing a `TypeError` claiming that an object `has no method 'compare'`, it is because you are on a version of Node older than 0.12, before the `compare` method was added to Buffers. Try upgrading to at least Node version 0.12.

  * If you are getting wallet decryption errors despite having correct credentials, then it's possible that you do not have Java installed, which is required by a dependency of the my-wallet-v3 module. Not having Java installed during the `npm install` process can result in the inability to decrypt wallets. Download the JDK from [here for Mac](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572) or by running `apt-get install default-jdk` on debian-based linux systems.

Timeout Errors:

  * If you are getting a timeout response, additional authorization from your blockchain wallet may be required. This can occur when using an unrecognized browser or IP address. An email authorizing the API access attempt will be sent to the registered user that will require action in order to authorize future requests.

## Usage

After installing the service, the command `blockchain-wallet-service` will be available for use.

### Options

  * `-h, --help` - output usage information
  * `-V, --version` - output the version number
  * `-c, --cwd` - use the current directory as the wallet service module (development only)

### Commands

#### start

Usage: `blockchain-wallet-service start [options]`

This command will start the service, making Blockchain Wallet API V2 available on a specified port.

Command options:

  * `-h, --help` - output usage information
  * `-p, --port` - port number to run the server on (defaults to `3000`)
  * `-b, --bind` - bind to a specific ip (defaults to `127.0.0.1`, note that binding to an ip other than this can lead to security vulnerabilities)
  * `--ssl-key` - the path to your ssl key (optional)
  * `--ssl-cert` - the path to your ssl certificate (optional)

To open the service to all incoming connections, bind to `0.0.0.0`.

#### start-rpc

Usage: `blockchain-wallet-service start-rpc [options]`

This command will start the JSON RPC server.

Options:

  * `-k, --key` - api code to use for server requests (required option)
  * `-p, --rpcport` - rpc server port (default: 8000)
  * `-b, --bind` - bind to a specific ip (defaults to `127.0.0.1`, note that binding to an ip other than this can lead to security vulnerabilities)

### Examples

To start the Wallet API service on port 3000:

```sh
$ blockchain-wallet-service start --port 3000
```

## Development

  1. Clone this repo
  2. Run `npm install`
  3. Run `npm start`
  4. Dev server is now running on port 3000

If you are developing `blockchain-wallet-client` alongside this module, it is useful to create a symlink to `my-wallet-v3`:

```sh
$ ln -s ../path/to/my-wallet-v3 node_modules/blockchain-wallet-client
```

### Testing

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Configuration

Optional parameters can be configured in a `.env` file:

  * `PORT` - port number for running dev server (default: `3000`)
  * `BIND` - ip address to bind the service to (default: `127.0.0.1`)

## Deployment

If you want to use blockchain-wallet-service in your UNIX production server, you just have to run:

```sh
$ nohup blockchain-wallet-service start --port 3000 &
```
